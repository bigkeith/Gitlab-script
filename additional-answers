Question #2 slow page loads

the answer can lie withing a the main componenets and be broken down further.
first I would ensure that network throughtput is optimal between the client and the source.
second I would investigate the major components of the app starting with the web server as the logs could provide information into which component is failing. I am not an expert at debugung code,
but an application built on php  could have some logging enabled that would point to an issue in the app or while gathering resources such data from a mysql database or images in an object repository.
there could also be issue where javascript is pulling data/resources that is geolocated and this would also contribute to slowness if a data is being pulled from the wrong location.

in terms of what can be investigated per component
webserver - performnance configuration in respect to the available memory and the fact that it is shared with the MYSQL server 
DATABASE - Mysql has some best practice configurations and should be configured in a way that takes account for the other components of the app. also in this case we would test queries and ensure that primary keys are set to speed the retrieval of data
php - check php/application log ensure that the performance configuration is consistent 

Question #3

assuming we are already in main(master) 

git add $change
git commit -m ""
git add $change
git commit -m ""
git branch feature-branch
git add $change
git commit -m ''
git merge feature-branch



Question #4
HOW IMPLEMENT A NEW FEAATURE USING GIT

Clone the main branch. this will download a copy of a project and you will have free range to mmake any changes you need.
# git clone path-to-existing-project
To make sure you always have a working code base you will want to create a new branch to work from in some case you may need more than one. but for this example we will keep it simple
#git branch my-new-branch

Switch to your new branch 
#git checkout my-mew-branch

At this point you have a code base to work from and merge changes when you are ready 

after testing you will want to merge you changes to the master codebase with the following:

#git merge my-new-branch
